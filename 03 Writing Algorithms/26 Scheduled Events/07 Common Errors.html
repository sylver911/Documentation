<p>Common errors with Scheduled Events include <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/trade-fills/key-concepts#06-Stale-Fills'>stale fills</a> and execution timeouts.</p>

<h4>Stale Fills</h4>
<p>A common error is to subscribe to daily resolution data and set a Scheduled Event intraday to place trades. If you trade intraday with daily data, you get stale fills.</p>

<p>Another common error is to set a Scheduled Event to trade immediately after the market open on illiquid securities. Illiquid securities can have no trades for the first few minutes after the market open. If you trade during this time, you get stale fills.</p>

<h4>Execution Timeouts</h4>
<p>If your Scheduled Event takes longer than 10 minutes to execute, your algorithm will timeout. To increase the amount of time that your Scheduled Event can run, replace your Scheduled Event with a <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/machine-learning/training-models'>training session</a>.</p>

<h4>Invoking the Callback Method</h4>
<p>Make sure to not accidentally invote the event handler method by adding trailing braces <code>()</code>. 
Use <code class="python">self._event_handler_func</code><code class="csharp">MyCallbackFunction</code>, not <code class="python">self._event_handler_func()</code><code class="csharp">MyCallbackFunction()</code>.
